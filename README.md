### Recommendation 

- Focus on Underperforming Segments: Enhance revenue and tax contributions in the mid-market and channel partner segments. Utilize the strong revenue from the government sector to scale operations and refine tax strategies. Target efforts to improve profitability and tax efficiency in these underperforming areas.

- Optimize State Performance: Develop strategies to boost revenue in lower-performing states like Ondo, while maintaining strong revenue generation in leading states such as Oyo and Lagos. Focus on improving tax efficiency and explore ways to balance revenue and tax contributions across all states for sustained growth.

- Leverage Biro's Success: Capitalize on Biro's strong performance and high tax contribution to enhance overall profitability. Reassess pricing strategies and cost structures for Notepad, Markers, and Stapler to address negative tax contributions. Improve revenue and tax efficiency for Pencil and A4 Paper to maximize their financial impact.

- Enhance Sales Consistency: Take advantage of strong sales periods in June, October, and December by implementing targeted promotions or increasing stock during these months. Analyze factors driving A4 paper's high sales to replicate successful strategies across other products, and investigate reasons for lower sales in other months to stabilize revenue year-round.

- Replicate Success Across Products: Use Biro's strong sales to further promote this product and explore opportunities to enhance the performance of Notepad, Markers, Stapler, and Pencil. Develop marketing campaigns or promotional offers for A4 Paper to boost its market share and overall performance, informed by sales trends and customer preferences.

- Improve Profitability: Maintain Biro’s strong sales performance while seeking ways to optimize costs. Address the negative profit margins of Notepad, Markers, and Stapler by revisiting pricing strategies and cost management. Implement measures to enhance profitability for these products, while scaling production and sales efforts for Pencil and A4 Paper.

- Support Financial Health: Continue to leverage Biro’s significant - -profit and tax contributions to bolster overall financial health. For Pencil and A4 Paper, consider strategies to enhance profitability and optimize tax contributions. Analyze and improve cost structures, pricing strategies, and operational efficiencies for Markers, Notepad, and Stapler to turn around negative profit and tax outcomes.

- Consider Product Discontinuation: To improve overall profitability, it is advisable to discontinue the three least profitable products: Markers (loss of $0.8 million), Notepad (loss of $20.2 million), and Stapler (loss of $21.2 million).

- Evaluate Low-Performing Products: When assessing discontinuation based on revenue, consider removing Stapler ($18.1 million), Pencil ($15.7 million), and A4 Paper ($14.1 million) from the product lineup due to their suboptimal financial performance.

- Enhance Margins in Specific Segments: Focus on strategies to improve profit margins in the Channel Partners and Mid-Market segments, which currently exhibit negative margins. Targeted interventions to reduce costs or increase revenue could help balance financial performance across all segments. Insights from the higher margins in the Small Business segment may be applicable to the less profitable areas.

- Prioritize Stapler and Notepad: Enhance strategies for Stapler and Notepad, given their significantly negative profit margins. Investigate cost reduction or pricing adjustments for these products. Leverage the strong performance of A4 Paper, Pencil, and Biro to replicate their success in other product lines.

- Boost Profitability in Ogun State: Implement targeted initiatives to improve profitability in Ogun State, which has the lowest profit margin. Analyze successful practices in Ondo and Osun States to identify adaptable strategies for enhancing margins in lower-performing regions.

### Conclusion
